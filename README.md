# resume

- In IT world everyday I learn something new.
- For that particular reason from time to time I need to update my resume with a new technology I learnt.
- I use different computers on a daily basis and I don't have a comfort of using same software every single time (various software versions of ms word, libre office, google docs etc).
- Until now I was struggling with opening my files on different machines - there was always some unexpected behaviour with formatting.
- To solve that issue and have a consistent behaviour every single time I open a document I decided to create my resume in HTML and CSS.
- The goal is to deliver clear, easy to read resume that can be opened on any device without any issues.
